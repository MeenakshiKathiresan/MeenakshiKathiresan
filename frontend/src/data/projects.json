By developing a dashboard and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, I have gained hands-on experience in building user-friendly interfaces and efficiently managing patient data. This project has allowed me to enhance my skills and proficiency in full-stack web development. I learnt to create basic analytics based on the data available and present it as a dashboard. The impact of this project extends beyond personal growth. It has the potential to streamline the vaccination process, improve patient management, and contribute to better public health outcomes. By providing a comprehensive tracking system, it can assist in monitoring the progress and outcomes of clinical trials, ultimately making a positive difference in people's lives."
